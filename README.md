# Assignment - Cakes and Bakes
Code for Front End Web Development Assignment CTEC3905

##Problems
- The API used renders ingredients from the recipe. On Champagne Cake, the recipe on the website, has url's to other recipe pages, therefore has been pulled through onto my site. [actual page](https://api.edamam.com/recipe/champagne-cake-2a64d9455d37807aef0e5674bfa57928/cake).

## References

- API was used from [here](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api).
However, the code was built myself with some guidance of tutors.

- Animated cake code was adapted from [here](https://github.com/elenatorro/CSSCake).

- All images were my own unless it has come from the API if not then google was my best friend for a [couple](https://www.google.com/search?q=cake&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiCl7ncgszoAhXr2eAKHcA_DzkQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=ca&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgQIIxAnMgQIIxAnMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgQIABBDOgcIIxDqAhAnUOVHWM9UYKFeaAFwAHgCgAFZiAGBA5IBATWYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ7ABCg&sclient=img&ei=TgyHXoK4NOuzgwfA_7zIAw&bih=657&biw=1366&rlz=1C1CHBF_enGB882GB882&safe=off&hl=en-GB).

- The modal was adapted from [this](https://www.cssscript.com/demo/simplest-modal-component-pure-javascript/) example.

- Most text content was either [lorem ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) or hand typed.

- Animated flip card was used from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_flip_card).
